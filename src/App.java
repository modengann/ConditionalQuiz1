/** Task:
 *  1. Write code that will take a single input from the user
 *  2. Write code that will determine whether the input is divisible: by 2, or by 3, or by both 2 and 3, or by neither.
 *     The code will then output a relevant message, for example:
 *     "This number is divisible by 2, but not 3"
 *     "This number is divisible by 3, but not 2"
 *     "This number is divisible by 2 and 3"
 *     "This number is divisible by neither 2 nor 3"
